I submit the following for assessment as my best class.

* All GUI part is my work. Not a specific method in the GUI (JavaFX) part is
  respectively more significant than others, but all methods collaborate with others
  and contribute to the fantastic design submitted.

* I really appreciate the online open source platforms which I really benefit from
  and thanks to my group mates' methods in terms of the back-end programming, which
  enables me to visualize the "next step hint" & "interesting starting pieces".
  Especially, the "notObsturct" really makes a difference!

I declare that this is entirely my own work, with the following documented exceptions:
